Desmund has a barrel in the marketplace
molly is the singer in a band
desmuns says to molly "god i like your face"
and mylly says uninteligible takes him by the hand

Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, life goes on uninteligible
uninteligible life goes on (2x)

Desmund takes a trolly to the juwelery store
buys a 20karot golder ring
takes it back to molly waiting at the door
and as he gives it to her she begines to sing

Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, life goes on uninteligible
uninteligible life goes on (2x)

in a couple of years they have built a home-sweet-home
with a couple of kids running in the yard
but desmond and molly don't
(hahaha)
happy ever after in the marketplace
desmund lets the childern lend a hand
molly stays at home and dose uninteligible
and in the evening she still sings it with the band

Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, life goes on uninteligible
uninteligible life goes on (2x)

in a couple of years they have built a home-sweet-home
with a couple of kids running in the yard
but desmond and molly don't
